# NEATrobot
This folder contains the python code running the ANN on the Raspberry Pi and receives the inputs via UART from the Arduino and then sends back the outputs from the ANN.

The original project is based on [piCore](http://www.tinycorelinux.net/), but this code can be run on raspbian too.

The camerafeed folder contains the webserver written in javascript with Node.JS to show the camera live feed of the robot.
